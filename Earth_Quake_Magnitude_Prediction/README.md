## About the Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle Earthquake Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farazrahman/earthquake)

### Context

This data set is taken from the USGS (U.S. Geological Survey). The USGS provides reliable scientific information to describe and understand the Earth; minimize loss of life and property from natural disasters; manage water, biological, energy, and mineral resources; and enhance and protect our quality of life.

As part of its program, the USGS monitors and reports on earthquakes, assesses earthquake impacts and hazards, and conducts targeted research on the causes and effects of earthquakes. The USGS provides real-time notifications, feeds, and web services about earthquakes just after they happen.
