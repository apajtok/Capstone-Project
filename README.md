# Capstone-Project
The frameworks used in this notebook are:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
sklearn (scikit-learn): For machine learning tasks, including model selection, training, evaluation, and anomaly detection.
xgboost: For gradient boosting regression.
lightgbm: For gradient boosting regression.
tensorflow: For building and training the ST-GCN model.
scipy: Specifically scipy.spatial.distance for calculating distances between spatial points.
matplotlib: For data visualization.
